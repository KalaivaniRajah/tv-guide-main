# TV Guide

To create an application that allows users to view horizontal lists of TV shows based on their rating and genre. When the user clicks on a TV show then the details of that TV show should
be displayed on another screen. Also, the user should be able to search for a TV show to get
the details.

## Project setup

npm is the recommended installation method when building large scale applications with Vue. It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as Webpack (opens new window) or Rollup (opens new window). Vue also provides accompanying tools for authoring Single File Components.

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

# Guidelines
## Prerequisites

### Install Node.js
Node.js is required as the libraries required for Vue are downloaded using node package manager (npm).

### Install Vue CLI
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

## Naming Conventions
* Files are named following Pascal case.
* Tags of Components are named using kabab-case.


## Style Scope
Scoping styles to a component element improves predictability as its prevents styles leaking outside the component element.

Bootstrap is a surprisingly powerful and effective tool for developers building responsive websites and web applications.


## Vuex
Vuex is Vueâ€™s own state management pattern and library. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. I


## ESLint

Linters improve code consistency and help trace syntax errors. .vue files can be linted adding the eslint-plugin-html in your project. If you choose, you can start a project with ESLint enabled by default using vue-cli.
